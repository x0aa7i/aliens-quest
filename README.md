| [The Great Filter](./src/content/solutions/great-filter/index.md)           | There's a barrier — biological, technological, or sociological — that prevents life from advancing to interstellar stages. | <a href="https://aliensquest.com/solutions/great-filter" target="_blank">↗️</a>        |
| [Incomprehensibility](./src/content/solutions/incomprehensibility/index.md) | Alien life may exist but be so different from us that we fail to recognize or interpret its signals.                       | <a href="https://aliensquest.com/solutions/incomprehensibility" target="_blank">↗️</a> |
| [Percolation Theory](./src/content/solutions/percolation/index.md)          | Civilizations may expand unevenly, forming isolated bubbles that never reach each other.                                   | <a href="https://aliensquest.com/solutions/percolation" target="_blank">↗️</a>         |
| [The Prime Directive](./src/content/solutions/prime-directive/index.md)     | Advanced civilizations intentionally avoid contact with less advanced ones, as a form of ethical non-interference.         | <a href="https://aliensquest.com/solutions/prime-directive" target="_blank">↗️</a>     |
| [Rare Earth](./src/content/solutions/rare-earth/index.md)                   | Complex life is extremely rare due to a unique set of astronomical and geological conditions found only on Earth.          | <a href="https://aliensquest.com/solutions/rare-earth" target="_blank">↗️</a>          |
| [Self-Destruction](./src/content/solutions/self-destruction/index.md)       | Civilizations tend to destroy themselves before achieving the ability to communicate or explore space.                     | <a href="https://aliensquest.com/solutions/self-destruction" target="_blank">↗️</a>    |
| [The Simulation](./src/content/solutions/simulation/index.md)               | We may be living in a simulation, and the absence of aliens is simply part of the programmed environment.                  | <a href="https://aliensquest.com/solutions/simulation" target="_blank">↗️</a>          |
| [The Zoo](./src/content/solutions/zoo/index.md)                             | Earth is deliberately isolated and observed, much like animals in a zoo, to avoid disrupting our natural development.      | <a href="https://aliensquest.com/solutions/zoo" target="_blank">↗️</a>                 |
